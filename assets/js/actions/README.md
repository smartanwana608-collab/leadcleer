# CSV Actions

This folder contains individual CSV action modules.

Each file here will handle a specific CSV operation such as:
- Removing rows with missing emails
- Splitting CSV by column value
- Removing duplicates
- Fixing addresses
- Creating new columns

These actions are triggered by the prompt-based CSV tool.
